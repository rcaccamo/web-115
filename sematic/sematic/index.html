            <h2>Pay The Boatman</h2>
            <p>This is our first release on CD. We have since launched it on Spotify and other media streaming locations. The lyrics are a little dark and were written when I was in a depressive stage of my life.

            <h3>Lyrics for Pay The Boatman</h3>
            <p>
                     Why do these feeling hit me like a brick
                <br> Tears me apart inside it all happens so quick
                <br> Flares up burning, injecting evil sadness
                <br> Infection spreading, holding in the madness
                <br>
                <br> Why, Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br> Why Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br>
                <br> Fealings about me, worsen and crumble
                <br> Taking from myself all that was humble
                <br> Once in its reach, its all downhill from there
                <br> Not letting you know, not letting them care
                <br>
                <br> Why, Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br> Why Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br>
                <br> why...
                <br> you won't always see
                <br> Depression,
                <br> right inside of me
                <br> Expression,
                <br> you won't know I'm down
                <br> Depression,
                <br> go away don't be found
                <br>
                <br> Go away, don't be found
                <br> Go away, don't be found
                <br>
                <br> Keeps on taking over soon I'll be empty
                <br> Ruinning me entirely, that's its specialty
                <br> Conquering me slowly, retreat, run away
                <br> Warping my mind and forcing me to stay
                <br>
                <br> Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br> Why Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br> 
                <br> There's no medicine for its sickness in mind
                <br> Drowning me slowly, hard to see, hard to find
                <br> If there's a cure, use it on me please
                <br> Can't stop the sadness, can't stop its disease
                <br>
                <br> Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br> Why Why
                <br> Tell me
                <br>
                <br> why...
                <br> you won't always see
                <br> Depression,
                <br> right inside of me
                <br> Expression,
                <br> you won't know I'm down
                <br> Depression,
                <br> go away don't be found
                <br>
                <br> Go away, don't be found
                <br> Go away, don't be found
                <br> Go away, don't be found
                <br> Go away, don't be found
                <br>
                <br> I can't survive, very much longer
                <br> In this world, too much longer
                <br> Why can't I survive, and be much stronger
                <br> I'm still alive, for how much longer
